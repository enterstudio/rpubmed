Tools for extracting and processing records from Pubmed and Pubmed Central.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project is still very much in development... Please contact me with any questions, suggestions or bug reports.

I have built in support for searching and processing [MeSH headings](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/disted/meshtutorial/introduction/index.html), making this package of particular use for biomedical researchers conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

### Done:

* fetch - Tools for bulk downloading of Pubmed records
* textsearch  - Tools for text-mining of abstracts and metadata from downloaded records
* io - saving records to disk and printing summaries of abstract lists to file or sdout
* Geocoding functionality added for finding the coordinates of departments affiliated with Pubmed Articles.
* fix mesh headings search

### Doing:

* Association matrices / Network graphs of article MeSH headings
* Download Pubmed IDs by article titles


### To do:

* More sophisticated text-mining functions
* Improve geocoding hit-rate
* Download and mine PMC articles
* Example gh_pages page
* Improve this page
* Documenting io file
